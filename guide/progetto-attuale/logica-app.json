    "architectural_pattern": "The fix was implemented in the `penalty.service.ts` by adding a check to verify if a user has a session record in the `user_sessions` table before applying penalties.",
    "user_flow": [
      "1. A user logs in.",
      "2. The frontend calls the `/api/leagues/[id]/check-compliance/` endpoint for each manager in the league.",
      "3. The `processUserComplianceAndPenalties` function in `penalty.service.ts` is called.",
      "4. The function now checks if the user has any session records in the `user_sessions` table.",
      "5. If the user has no session records, the function returns immediately, and no penalty is applied.",
      "6. If the user has session records, the penalty logic proceeds as before."
